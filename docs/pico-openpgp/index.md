# Pico OpenPGP

Pico OpenPGP implements an OpenPGP-compatible smartcard interface for managing cryptographic keys used in encryption, signing, and authentication.

Typical use cases include:

- GPG-based workflows
- Code signing
- Secure email
- SSH authentication

The device performs cryptographic operations internally, keeping private keys protected at all times.
