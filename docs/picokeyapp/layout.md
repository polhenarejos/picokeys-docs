# Application layout

PicoKeyApp is divided into two main areas: a sidebar for navigation and a main panel for content.

## Sidebar navigation

The left sidebar provides access to the main sections:

- **Home** – Device status and general information
- **Configuration** – Device commissioning and configuration
- **Security** – Security-related options (firmware-dependent)
- **About** – Application information, diagnostics, and license management

The available sections and options may change depending on the firmware running on the device.

## Main panel

The main panel displays the content of the selected section.

Some views may become scrollable depending on the amount of information displayed.
