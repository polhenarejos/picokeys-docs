# PicoKey App

PicoKe App is the desktop application used to manage **PicoKeys devices**.

It provides a local user interface for:

- Device detection
- Device configuration and commissioning
- Security-related settings (firmware-dependent)
- FIDO management (passkeys, accounts, and slots)
- App settings
- License and board registration

PicoKey App communicates directly with the device over USB and exposes only the features supported by the currently installed firmware.
