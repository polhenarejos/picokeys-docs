# Pico FIDO Management

The FIDO management documentation is split into these pages:

- [Passkeys](passkeys.md): resident credentials, credential state, and unlock flow.
- [Accounts](accounts.md): OATH accounts (TOTP/HOTP), creation flow, and locked state.
- [Slots](slots.md): OTP slot provisioning and per-slot actions.
